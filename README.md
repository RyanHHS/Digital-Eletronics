# Digital-Eletronics


## Week 7 (Midterm)

## Week 6 (Midterm)

## Week 5 (Midterm)
I seperate the idea into smaller parts. For this project I am creating the hands part, where when rider raise the hand, LED lights will light up to signal turns.

### To do this I gethered the materials listed below:

  ### 1. Arduino UNO board
  ### 2. Adafruit Flora LSM303DLHM Accel + Compass Sensor
  ### 3. Adafruit NeoPixel RGB LED lights (4)

## Week 4 (Midterm)
After some more inspiration, I changed my idea to a wearable tech (consider my background as jewelry designer). I want to make a Bike light that is attached to rider's hand and body, and is able to signal when turning left and right. My bigger idea is to create a suit for safer ride in the city. I want to create it with everyday clothes like denim jacket. with LED lights and sensors attached.

## Week 2
-I like this project because as a chinese speaker, it is very natural for me to use the tones. But it is a good idea for a learning device.
