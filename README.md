## Final Project - Part 01

With the final project, I came up with 3 initial idea. Due to limited supply and other constraint, in the end I choose the Notification Amplifier.

Third idea: Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the SF Bay Area is carrying out WORK FROM HOME and SOCIAL DISTANCING policy. During the time at home I tend to leave my phone on the table and check the phone less than usual. the become a problem because people is hard to find me or for me to access information at first hand. Therefore I want to create a lamp that tells me if I have a notification coming in.

Second idea: Due to the recent (2020 April) Covid-19 pandemic, I want to create something that can make our lives better in the situation. So I want to create a hand wash timer, where it will be placed beside the sink or on the wall. Whenever the user is washing hands, the most effective duration is at least 20 seconds in order to kill all the virus.

First idea: I am think of hacking the push bar door with a "Door Opener", because I in my daily life, I constainly gets lock out of this one-way door. If I want to get back inside the building, I will have to go all the way to another door. 



## Week 7 (Midterm)



### Midterm Arduino Code Please See File: "midterm_arduino_code/accelsensor"



In the future, I want to make the sensor and the LED lights on the jacket so it's easier to wear and more fashionable. I found some conductive thread that I think would work great on clothes, as well as other smaller boards (eg. Feather). I also want to make the backside of the jacket for slowing/stopping signals, which may use other sensors to activate. Overall I really enjoy making the project. Starting from scratch, solving problems step by step towards making a workable prototype. 


Then I attach all the components together. I bought some velcro strips for the handles on the sides, for straping the prototype on to the hand.

## Week 6 (Midterm)

After I am done with testing and I start making the outer case with Rhino5 for prototype. Then I 3D printed in the lab.
Schematic:

testing the sensor and the code, you will be able to find the X, Y, Z axis directions in the sensor and then fine tune it to the hand gestures of the rider rasing hand to signal turning left or right. After setting up the code for the sensor, then I add LED light code together to turn on/off when different gesture is made.

## Week 5 (Midterm)
I seperate the idea into smaller parts. For this project I am creating the hands part, where when rider raise the hand, LED lights will light up to signal turns.

 To do this I gethered the materials listed below:

   1. Arduino UNO board
   2. Adafruit Flora LSM303DLHM Accel + Compass Sensor
   3. Adafruit NeoPixel RGB LED lights (4)

## Week 4 (Midterm)
After some more inspiration, I changed my idea to a wearable tech (consider my background as jewelry designer). I want to make a Bike light that is attached to rider's hand and body, and is able to signal when turning left and right. My bigger idea is to create a suit for safer ride in the city. I want to create it with everyday clothes like denim jacket. with LED lights and sensors attached.

## Week 2
-I like this project because as a chinese speaker, it is very natural for me to use the tones. But it is a good idea for a learning device.
